# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    During this course, I was given most of the code for the AI except for parts of project two where I coded the main loop which made it so the agent could do the maze in both an exploration and exploitation way. The primary focus of this course was the focus on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and how it is made. We did this using reinforcement learning, we also looked at Deep Q learning as well as AI like AlphaGO and AlphaGo Zero which showed how AI is getting more advanced and capable of training itself on a subject instead of just mirroring what a human would do or did in that scenario. The final thing that we talked about was the ethics of AI and how they have become more prevalent in recent years in everything from chatbots online to toys in some cases.
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        What a computer scientist does is develop new technology and software as well as solve problems, the way they go about this is by using the scientific method where they hypothesize and experiment with their new ideas to provide new technology or better optimize technology that is already out.
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        The most important part of problem-solving is to first understand what the actual problem is. What that means is to get all the information from the client such as what the problem is they see, how they would like the finished product to look, how constrained you will be when making these changes such as monetary and time-wise, and finally if you or your company could accomplish what the client is looking for. 
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        Ethics is one of the most important things when doing anything, but I can't think of any concrete rules besides always being honest and trying to not harm the user in any way. Another good factor of this is to obtain consent from the client or user to do something (goes along with transparency) and try to have them informed about the entire process and if they are informed then there shouldn't be any ethical issues.
